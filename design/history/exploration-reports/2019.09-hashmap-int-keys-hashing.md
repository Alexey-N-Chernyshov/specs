HashMap: Int keys, and how to consistently hash them
====================================================

The following text was included in an original [proposal](https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/180) to extend schema-layer/data-structures/hashmap.md (under "Key hashing") to support more key types. It was a proposal of a possible way to formalise a consistent hashing approach for integer keys that would work across language runtimes. This is not the only possible way, but if integer keys were allowed then we would need to formalise a specific method that could be consistently reused across implementations.

Also below is a note about possible use of HashMap with int keys as a sparse array where ordering is not important.

--------------------------------------

## Key encoding: Int

Integers must first be converted to byte arrays before being hashed. In order to perform consistent hashing across languages, platforms and their number implementations, we must choose a byte representation format and the length of bytes to be hashed.

For the common case of numbers in the 32-bit signed range, that is, from `- 2`<sup>`31`</sup> to `(2`<sup>`31`</sup>`) - 1`, or `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647` we encode it as bytes in little-endian form to 4 bytes. This also includes numbers in the 8 and 16-bit range

For numbers outside of this range, we encode to 8 bytes in 64-bit little-endian signed form. Encoding behavior for numbers outside of the 64-bit range (`- 2`<sup>`63`</sup> to `(2`<sup>`63`</sup>`) - 1`, or `âˆ’9,223,372,036,854,775,807` to `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`) is left undefined. However, encoding in 16-bits little-endian for the 128-bit range, and so on, is recommended if such support is possible and required for a given implementation of this specification.

Unsigned integers should be represented in signed form for the purpose of hashing.

The details of this conversion to bytes should be transparent to the user as the original integers are stored in the key/value pair location in buckets and only returned to users as the correct data model kind.

--------------------------------------

## Use as a sparse array

Using a HashMap with integer keys supports operation as an efficient sparse array **for non-iteration operations only**. Because hashing is performed on the byte array format of integer keys, entries will be distributed as evenly as the hash algorithm affords.

Ordered iteration is not supported in HashMap, only hash-ordered iteration which is meaningless in most circumstances. So where a sparse array is required to be in ordered format for iteration purposes, a HashMap is not suitable and another collection type should be chosen.
